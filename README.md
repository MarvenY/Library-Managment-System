# Library Managment System (LMS)
This is my final Object Oriented Programing/Design project using C# and elucidating the employed design concept through the utilization of UML diagrams

This Program took about 3 days to complete as we were on a very short notice and unexpected changes.

You can find below some images of the software developed :
